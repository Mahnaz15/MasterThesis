# MasterThesis

My master thesis topic was "Integration of an LXC-based Node Type into the CORE Network Emulator"

The main objective of this thesis is to develop an extension to support LXC container as node type in the CORE network Emulator. This research focuses on extending the implementation of default CORE node type to LXC node type and then retrieve some possible configurable aspects for LXC node such as container image selection, specify a limitation for CPU and RAM usage.
